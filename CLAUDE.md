# Commit Conventions

This repo enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via a Husky `commit-msg` hook
(commitlint) plus a GitHub Actions backstop. Run `npm install` once to activate the local hook. Details and
examples: [commit-conventions.md](./docs/commit-conventions.md).

# Sample Solutions

The `sample-solution` directory (in the `angular-workshop` repository, added there as a git submodule pointing to `git@github.com:workshops-de/angular-workshop.git`) contains the sample solutions for the lessons' tasks. Each commit in that submodule is the solution to one task.
